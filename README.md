Backend: Node.js
Database: PostgreSQL
Frontend: React.js

# steps to be followed:

1. The frontend consists of two pages:
   a) Page with a search bar and a "Submit" button
   b) Page with a list and a "Add Company" button

2. When the search query is entered, the backend will fetch a list of companies from https://www.zaubacorp.com (You are to use the same API used by the zaubacorp search bar)

3. On clicking Submit, the company name and CIN (company identification number) is to be saved to a local PostgreSQL DB instance (include the database and table schema in a file in your repository).

4. Once saved, redirect to the list page where all the saved companies are to be displayed.
